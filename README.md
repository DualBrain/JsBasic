# JsBasic

A BASIC to Javascript compiler/transpiler utilizing [Irony](https://github.com/IronyProject/Irony) and developed using VB targeting .NET 7.

## Inspiration

The primary inspiration of this project is a combination of both the included example in [Irony](https://github.com/IronyProject/Irony) as well as the [Code Project article, JSBasic - A BASIC to JavaScript Compiler](https://www.codeproject.com/articles/25069/jsbasic-a-basic-to-javascript-compiler); both of which are implemented in C#. The awareness of [Irony](https://github.com/IronyProject/Irony) is thanks to [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/the-weekly-source-code-59-an-open-source-treasure-irony-net-language-implementation-kit).
